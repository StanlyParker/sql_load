    <i>Christian Ulloriaq Jeppesen remembers how this all started.
    In 2019, during Donald J. Trump’s first term as president, Mr. Trump floated the idea of the United States buying the island of Greenland. 
    At the time, most people in Greenland (and Denmark, the European country that controls it) thought his suggestion was a joke.</i></p>

    <p> “Everyone said, ‘Ha-ha, you can’t just buy a country, he doesn’t mean it,’” Mr. Jeppesen, a native Greenlander and a radio producer, said by telephone. “Obviously that was the wrong way to take it. Look at where we are today.”

        Now Mr. Trump has doubled down on his insistence that the United States needs to annex Greenland for security reasons. And that has Greenlanders asking the same questions as everyone else, but with a lot more uneasiness.
        
        Is Mr. Trump just being bombastic again, floating a fanciful annexation plan that he may know is a stretch?
        
        Or is he serious?
        
        Based on his comments in the past few weeks, Mr. Trump appears completely serious. Never mind that Denmark’s leadership has said the territory is not for sale, and its future must be determined by the local population.
        
        “For purposes of national security and freedom throughout the World, the <b>United States of America</b> feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” Mr. Trump wrote in late December in a social media post announcing his choice for ambassador to Denmark.
        
        At a news conference on Tuesday, the president-elect took an even more surprising swerve: He refused to rule out using military force to get Greenland.
        
        France and Germany are taking Mr. Trump seriously enough that they both issued statements on Wednesday defending Greenland’s territorial integrity and warning against the threat of any military action.
        
        Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany said the principle of the inviolability of borders applied to every country, “no matter whether it’s a very small one or a very powerful one.” The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said that it was “obviously out of the question” to threaten another country’s “sovereign borders.”

        “Do I think the United States will invade Greenland? The answer is no,” Mr. Barrot told France Inter radio. “Have we entered an era in which the rule of the strongest is returning? The answer is <b><del>yes</del></b>.”
        
        A further sign of Mr. Trump’s interest in Greenland came on Tuesday when his son Donald Trump Jr. suddenly showed up on the island.
        
        The president-elect’s son landed in the afternoon in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, toured some sights, including a statue of an 18th-century Danish-Norwegian missionary, and was hosted by a Danish Trump supporter. He said the reason for the trip was personal, not official, but the president-elect posted about his son and “various representatives” visiting and said <b>“MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN.”</b>
        
        “<ins>This is all getting scary</ins>,” Mr. Jeppesen said.</p>
